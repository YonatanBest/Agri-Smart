# üåæ AgriLo ‚Äì Your AI Extension Worker in Your Pocket

## üìå Overview

AgriLo is the **first fully agentic AI agriculture assistant** designed for **smallholder farmers**, to get **personalized, real-time farming guidance** just by talking or sending a voice note. No more charts, no complex dashboards, AgriLo understands your needs and responds with **clear, actionable solutions** in your language.

---

## üåç Problem

These smallholder farms play a major role in food production. They operate around 12% of global farmland but produce about one-third of the world‚Äôs food. Yet the **farmer-to-extension-worker ratio** can be as bad as **1:10,000** in rural areas.

* **Gaps**: Limited access to timely weather, soil, and crop health information.
* **Existing tools**: Many digital agriculture apps are too technical, rely on raw charts, and ignore local languages/customs.
* **Impact**: Lower yields, missed climate adaptation opportunities, higher poverty risk ‚Äî especially for **women farmers** who make up almost **50%** of the labor force.

---

## üí° Our Solution

**AgriLo** acts as a **24/7 AI extension worker** that:

* Listens to the farmer‚Äôs needs (via **voice or text**)
* Understands local context (language, location, crop type)
* Automatically pulls real-time data (weather, soil, pests)
* Creates **weekly action plans** tailored to the farmer‚Äôs land and season

Farmers **don‚Äôt have to learn new technology** , they just **talk to AgriLo** and get answers.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Ask AgriLo** ‚Äì The farmer speaks or types their question:

   > ‚ÄúShould I irrigate today?‚Äù
   > ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with my maize leaves?‚Äù
2. **AgriLo Thinks for You** ‚Äì Uses geolocation, weather forecasts, soil datasets, and crop health AI models to decide.
3. **Gives Clear Guidance** ‚Äì E.g., ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt irrigate today, rain is expected tonight. Fertilize on Thursday.‚Äù
4. **Keeps Track** ‚Äì Adds actions to a personalized AI calendar and sends reminders.


---

## üíµ Business Model

* **Government & NGO Partnerships** ‚Äì Deploy AgriLo at scale as a low-cost extension service (100√ó cheaper than traditional agents).

## üöÄ Further technical development/scale (already started)

We tried to implement a user-friendly approach for farmers to input their land boundaries. This is a **GPS-based land mapping feature** that uses the phone's sensors to automatically trace the farmland perimeter, area and location. So no need for map drawing on the phone. But we faced a time shortage for the integration of the system to the current project. So we have a plan to continue in the integration of this important feature, but it is still accessible for testing in the `location_setter` branch in the GitHub. (Screenshot of the implementation test is available.)

- **Include SMS and USSD methods** to deliver data to farmers who do not have access to the internet or do not use a smartphone.
- We planned to design **Symbolic AI** ‚Äì so that our app would provide real accurate data. Since AI models are generic and sensitive to error margin
- We managed to test an AI model that can run offline without any internet access that can answer and chat with the farmers in agriculture. So in future we plan to design an app so that farmers can interact with our app without any internet bundle.

**Test Model:**      **Ollama run sike_aditya/AgriLlama**
This model can give suggestions on the disease of the plant and some agricultural advice. But we aim to have more robust AI that is an agricultural specialist, so we might need more resources to fine-tune another base model using agricultural datasets, and we plan to use **tensorflow lite** to minimize and quantize the size and complexity of the fine-tuned model. (We have tested on the **tensorflow lite** method and it is promising, for testing the **tensorflow-lite-test** branch.) For now, we decided to stick with **Gemini**.

**Colab Link** that we experimented on tensorflow lite: 
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/158-rip9q8HwslSV-YDm83DNo37E9L37x?usp=sharing

By using **AI agent** we can utilize automation so that the farmer schedule just by ai chat instruction, which it provides weekly report on the field

## üîÆ Further (Special) Feature development

Connect with **NGOs and Agricultural Financial advisors** so that we can empower small-scaled farmers to achieve their economic stability.

We plan to add one more feature called **"MarketPlace"**, it is where farmers receive contracts from government, and private companies, allowing them to sell their crops at fair price and market demand.
